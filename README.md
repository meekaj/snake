# Turtle Snake Game

This Python project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Turtle graphics library. Navigate the snake around the game area to eat leaves, grow longer, and increase your score. Avoid the game boundaries to keep playing!

## Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay: Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- Score tracking: Your score increases as the snake consumes leaves.
- Game over conditions: The game ends when the snake hits the boundaries of the game window.
- Restart capability: Press the spacebar to restart the game after a game over.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the game, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. The game is built using Python's built-in Turtle graphics library, so no additional installations are required.

## How to Run the Game

1. **Clone or download the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meekaj/snake.git
   cd turtle-snake-game
2. **Run the game:**
    python snake.py

## Controls
Start the game: Press the Space bar.
Move the snake: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).

### Game Rules
- The snake will grow in length each time it eats a leaf.
- The game's objective is to eat as many leaves as possible without colliding with the game window's boundaries.
- The game ends when the snake hits the boundaries, and you can restart the game by pressing the spacebar.
